Strong **front** and **backend** web developer seeking to join a solid team.

Interested in tools that **get the job done** while boosting **productivity**.

Believe good code is **easy to maintain**, **well tested**, and **easily extended**.

**Big on OSS** - I like knowing how the tools I use work.
