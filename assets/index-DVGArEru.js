Support production applications for the Learning Support Tools team.

LST is a small team of developers maintaining multiple production applications.  As much of the team is remote good communication is a must.  Pair programming is strongly encouraged.

A typical week may include bug fixes, feature work, coordination with other teams, meetings with architects, and coordinating deploys to AWS with SRE's.
